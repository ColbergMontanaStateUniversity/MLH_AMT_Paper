## Requirements

This project uses both **Python** and **MATLAB**:

- Python is required to download HRRR model data using the Herbie library.
- MATLAB is used for processing the HRRR data and performing operations on the data.
---

## Python Setup

This project uses **Miniconda** and was developed with **Python 3.12.9**. Youâ€™ll need either [Miniconda or Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#latest-miniconda-installer-links) installed to recreate the environment.

Miniconda is recommended if you prefer a lightweight installation.

To set up the Python environment:

## MATLAB Setup

Tested with **MATLAB R2024a**  
No additional toolboxes are required.

### Step 1: Download the environment file

Download `herbie_env_full.yml` from this repository.

### Step 2: Create and activate the environment

```bash
conda env create -f herbie_env_full.yml
conda activate herbie_env
```

This will install all required packages, including:
- `herbie` for accessing HRRR model output
- `cfgrib` for reading GRIB2 files
- `xarray`, `pyproj`, `metpy`, and other scientific packages

## Step 3. Run the python script for downloading HRRR files

**Note:** the lattitude, longitude, and altitude are set to the M^2HATS site

Run the Python script `download_hrrr_files.py`.  
This will create new folders for each day processed.

```
HRRR_data/YYYYMMDD/
```

Each folder contains hourly NetCDF files from the HRRR model.  
**Note:** HRRR times are in **UTC**, not local time.

## Step 4. Run the matlab script to process the HRRR data

**Note:** 'load_hrrr_data' has a pressure cutoff of 875 hPa (This is below the ground in Tonopah)
**Note:** 'load_hrrr_data' has a time zone shift of UTC -7, which is spcific to PDT, local time for Tonopah, Nevada during the M^2HATS experiment
**Note:** 'concatenate_hrrr_data' has an elevation input, which is set to the M^2HATS site

Run the main script 'diagnose_mlh_hrrr' and set Path.date1 to the YYYYMMDD of the desired day and Path.date2 to the next day

## Function Descriptions

### `compute_mlh_parcel_hrrr_offset1K.m`
Computes the mixed layer height using a parcel method offset by +1 K from the surface virtual potential temperature.

### `compute_mlh_parcel_hrrr_standard.m`
Computes the mixed layer height using the standard parcel method without temperature offset.

### `concatenate_hrrr_data.m`
Concatenates two consecutive days of HRRR data and applies the UTC to PDT time correction. Also trims the time to -2 to 26 hours.

### `convert_pressure_to_altitude.m`
Interpolates pressure-level variables to altitude above ground level using geopotential height and fixed bin spacing.

### `convert_q_theta_vpt.m`
Computes specific humidity, potential temperature, and virtual potential temperature from RH, temperature, and pressure.

### `load_hrrr_data.m`
Loads and filters HRRR NetCDF files for a given day. Extracts variables of interest and applies a pressure-level cutoff.

### `diagnose_mlh_hrrr.m`
Main script. Loads, processes, and plots HRRR data and computed MLH values. Saves results to a `.mat` file.
