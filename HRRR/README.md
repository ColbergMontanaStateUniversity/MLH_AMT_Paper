## Requirements

This project uses both **Python** and **MATLAB**:

- Python is required to download HRRR model data using the Herbie library.
- MATLAB is used for processing the HRRR data and performing operations on the data.
---

## Python Setup

This project uses **Miniconda** and was developed with **Python 3.12.9**. Youâ€™ll need either [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) installed to recreate the environment.

Miniconda is recommended if you prefer a lightweight installation.

To set up the Python environment:

### Step 1: Download the environment file

Download `herbie_env_full.yml` from this repository.

### Step 2: Create and activate the environment

```bash
conda env create -f herbie_env_full.yml
conda activate herbie_env
```

This will install all required packages, including:
- `herbie` for accessing HRRR model output
- `cfgrib` for reading GRIB2 files
- `xarray`, `pyproj`, `metpy`, and other scientific packages


## MATLAB Setup

Tested with **MATLAB R2024a**  
No additional toolboxes are required.
